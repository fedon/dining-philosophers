http://rosettacode.org/wiki/Dining_philosophers

Five philosophers, Aristotle, Kant, Spinoza, Marx, and Russell (the tasks) spend their time thinking and eating
spaghetti. They eat at a round table with five individual seats. For eating each philosopher needs two forks
(the resources). There are five forks on the table, one left and one right of each seat. When a philosopher cannot
grab both forks it sits and waits. Eating takes random time, then the philosopher puts the forks down and leaves the
dining room. After spending some random time thinking about the nature of the universe, he again becomes hungry, and
the circle repeats itself.
